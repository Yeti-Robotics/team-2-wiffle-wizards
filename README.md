# Dave the Wizard's Ball Pit
Team 2's Robot Code

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design a competitive and efficient robot for the YETI Robotics 2024 CADathon. Our goal is to create a robot that optimizes electrolyte (wiffle ball) handling and delivery in line with the competition’s unique requirements. Inspired from our strategy, we named our robot "Dave the Wizard's Ball Pit"

## Project Overview
This document outlines the key features and operation of our robot, which is inspired by the WCP Dunk Tank concept and tailored to the CADathon specifications. The robot is equipped with a swerve drive, an optimized intake, a slanted box elevator mechanism, and a controlled flap release system for reliable electrolyte handling and delivery.

## Key Components and Mechanisms

### Swerve Drive
Mobility: Our robot uses a swerve drive system for enhanced maneuverability, allowing it to navigate the field and align precisely with electrolyte clusters.

### Electrolyte Intake System
Cheesy Poofs Inspired Design: The intake is based on Team 254’s Cheesy Poofs intake, designed to collect electrolytes quickly and smoothly for transfer.

### Elevator and Slanted Box
Elevator Mechanism: The elevator lifts the floor holding the electrolytes to the height of the dunk tank.
Slanted Box Design: The box’s base is angled, so when the elevator reaches the top, the electrolytes roll down the slope naturally for easy unloading.

### Flap Release System
Controlled Release: At the top of the elevator, a flap opens to allow the electrolytes to roll out. This system is designed to control the release timing and ensure a consistent delivery.

### Operation Summary
Intake Electrolytes: The intake collects the wiffle balls.
Elevate and Position: The elevator lifts the angled box to the delivery height.
Controlled Release: The flap opens at the top, allowing the wiffle balls to roll down the ramp and exit smoothly.
